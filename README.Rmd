# era5.aws R package
This R package (library) was created to handle ERA5 data obtained from Amazon (AWS) services.

## Clone the git repository
First, the repository containing the files needed to install the package must be cloned. From a terminal, run the following command:
```
$ git clone https://github.com/Gonzalo1985/era5.aws
```

## Pre-installed required packages
The era5.aws package needs to have the aws.s3 and devtools packages installed beforehand. From an R session run the following commands:
```{r, echo = TRUE, message = FALSE}
install.packages("aws.s3")
install.packages("devtools")
```
Then, open the "aws.s3" and "devtools" libraries:
```{r, echo = TRUE, message = FALSE}
library("aws.s3")
library("devtools")
```

## Package Installation
From the folder cloned with the files of the repository, execute the following command from an R console:
```{r, echo = TRUE, results = FALSE}
devtools::install()
```
